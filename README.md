# CiSTUP_IISc_python_test

This repository contains my submission for the CiSTUP IIScp Python Test. The aim of this competition was to test problem-solving skills and basic understanding of Python. I participated in this competition to challenge myself and showcase my coding and analytical abilities.


# Description
This competition focused on assessing participants' problem-solving skills and Python programming expertise. The tasks were designed to evaluate our ability to create efficient code and communicate findings through a well-structured report.

# Submission Contents
Question 1 Solution: The Python code for solving Question 1 can be found in the file question1_solution.ipynb. This file is structured according to PEP 8 style guidelines to ensure clean and readable code.

Question 2 Solution: The Python code for solving Question 2 is available in the file question2_solution.ipynb. This file adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines for consistency and readability.

Report: The report summarizing my findings from both questions is available as competition_report.pdf. The report includes clearly stated assumptions, informative visualizations, and insights derived from the solutions. It does not contain any copied code snippets.

# Instructions Followed
I adhered to the provided instructions for the competition, including:
Creating separate Python files for each question's solution.
Structuring Python files according to PEP 8 style guidelines.
Preparing a report in PDF format that summarizes assumptions, visualizations, and findings.
Avoiding plagiarism by writing original code and not copying code into the report.

# Code Style
To ensure code readability and maintainability, I followed the PEP 8 style guide throughout the development process. Adhering to these guidelines helps enhance the clarity and consistency of the code.
